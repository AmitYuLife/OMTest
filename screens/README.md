## 🎯 Screen Purpose

**The CRITICAL Moment**: This is the highest economic value moment in the member lifecycle. Job change/exit is when most pension leakage occurs through cash-outs.

**Design Goal**: Make preservation the obvious, easy choice—without pressure or sales tactics.

**Expected Impact**: If rolled out, this screen could help retain 70%+ of members at job change, reducing cash-out leakage from ~60% to <15%, potentially saving/retaining millions in pension assets.

## 📊 Design System Consistency

### Reuses from Existing Pensions Screen:
✅ Header (Old Mutual + ❤️ Yu branding)
✅ Hero structure (260px height, rounded bottom)
✅ Card styling (borders, shadows, radius)
✅ Typography (Bariol font family, same sizes)
✅ Color palette (OM green, teal, neutrals, Yu pink)
✅ Spacing system (8px grid, 24px sections, 16px cards)
✅ Button styles (shadow, radius, hover states)

### New Components Created:
🆕 Info box (green alert with icon)
🆕 Protected item row (icon + label + value)
🆕 Choice card (3 variants: recommended, warning, neutral)
🆕 Benefit/consequence list item (check/x icon + text)
🆕 Support section (adviser contact)
🆕 Member-for-Life badge (Yu gradient)

---

## 🧠 Behavioral Design Principles

### Why This Design Works:

1. **Default Effect**
   - Option 1 visually pre-selected (green, filled radio)
   - Makes preservation the path of least resistance

2. **Loss Aversion**
   - Shows what you lose if you cash out (cover, future value)
   - More powerful than showing gains alone

3. **Social Proof**
   - "Most people who cash out wish they hadn't"
   - Peer behavior influences decisions

4. **Anchoring**
   - R75k today vs R450k+ at retirement
   - Future value anchors against present temptation

5. **Choice Architecture**
   - 3 options (not 2 or 10)
   - Recommended highlighted, not hidden
   - Alternatives transparent, not demonized

6. **Framing**
   - "Stay with Old Mutual" (continuity) vs "Cash out" (loss)
   - "Member-for-Life" (belonging) vs "Transfer" (starting over)

## 🎤 Presentation Talking Points

When presenting to Old Mutual:

### Opening:
> "This is the most important screen in our concept. Job change is when we typically lose members and assets. This design makes preservation the obvious choice—transparently and without pressure."

### Key Points:
1. **Three clear options** → Trust through transparency
2. **Behavioral nudges** → Green highlighting, social proof
3. **Value visibility** → Shows what they've built first
4. **Adviser support** → Channel-supportive approach
5. **Member-for-Life** → Relationship continues

### The Ask:
> "If we get this one screen right, we could move the preservation needle from 40% to 70%+. That's millions in retained assets and thousands of members who stay in the Old Mutual family."

## 🔧 Technical Notes

### Data Integration Points:
```javascript
// Dynamic values to populate from API
{
  pension_value: "R75 193,54",        // member.pension.total_value
  life_cover: "R850,000",              // member.risk.life_cover_amount
  disability_cover: "R425,000",        // member.risk.disability_cover_amount
  tax_rate: "36%",                     // calculate_tax(pension_value, 'withdrawal')
  projected_value: "R450,000+",        // project_retirement_value(pension_value, age)
  adviser_name: "Your adviser"         // member.adviser.display_name || "An adviser"
}
```

### Personalization Hooks:
