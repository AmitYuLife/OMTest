## Additional Design Strengths (Beyond Requirements)

### 1. **Behavioral Economics Applied** ✅
- Default effect (Option 1 pre-selected visually)
- Loss aversion (shows what you lose if you cash out)
- Social proof ("most people who cash out wish they hadn't")
- Anchoring (R450k+ future value anchors against R75k today)
- Choice architecture (3 options, not 2 or 10)

### 2. **Accessibility Considered** ✅
- Color contrast meets WCAG AA
- Touch targets 44px+ minimum
- Semantic hierarchy (h1, h2, h3)
- Screen reader friendly
- Cognitive load managed (only 3 choices)

### 3. **Mobile-First Design** ✅
- 375px viewport optimized
- No horizontal scrolling
- One-handed operation possible
- Font sizes mobile-legible
- Thumb-friendly button placement

### 4. **Scalability Potential** ✅
- Components can be reused across other screens
- Choice card pattern works for other decisions
- Protected items pattern can show other values
- Info box pattern reusable for nudges

### 5. **Error Prevention** ✅
- Recommended option is pre-selected (prevents accidental cash-out)
- Radio buttons (can only pick one, not confusing checkboxes)
- Confirmation screen would follow (not implemented yet, but planned)

## Areas for Future Enhancement

### Nice-to-Have Features (Not Required for Initial Concept)

1. **AI Personalization** ⚠️
   - Could add: "Based on your situation..." personalized message
   - Could show: Customized retirement projection based on age
   - Could include: Smart recommendation reasons beyond default

2. **Dynamic Content** ⚠️
   - Tax calculation based on actual member pension value
   - Adviser photo and name (if available)
   - Personalized retirement age projection

3. **Interactive Elements** ⚠️
   - Expandable details on each option ("Learn more")
   - Calculator to see tax impact at different amounts
   - Comparison table toggle view

4. **Additional Context** ⚠️
   - Why preserve? Educational content
   - What happens next? Process timeline
   - FAQs section (collapsible)

5. **Social/Emotional Support** ⚠️
   - Video from adviser
   - Member testimonials ("I'm glad I preserved")
   - Community support option

**Note**: These are intentionally NOT included in v1 to keep focus on the core decision moment. Add only if user testing shows need.

## Screen Position in 8-Slide Deck

This screen is **Slide 4 of 8**:

1. Screen A: Unified Member Home (Anchor)
2. Screen B: Active Employment (Upsell/Cross-sell)
3. Screen C: Life Event / AI Insight
4. **Screen D: Employee Exit Journey** ← YOU ARE HERE (CRITICAL)
5. Screen E: Continuation as Individual
6. Screen F: Pre-Retirement Guidance
7. Screen G: Post-Retirement Engagement
8. Screen H: [TBD - Lifecycle Map / Adviser View / AI Dashboard / Success Story]

**Why Screen D is critical**: This is the highest economic value moment. If we get this wrong, we lose members and pension assets. If we get this right, we increase lifetime value by years/decades.

## Presentation Notes for Stakeholders

When presenting this screen:

### Opening Line:
> "This is the most important screen in our entire concept. Job change is when we typically lose members and pension assets. This screen makes preservation the obvious, easy choice—without pressure."

### Key Talking Points:
1. **Three clear options** → transparency builds trust
2. **Recommended option** → behavioral nudge without hiding alternatives
3. **Shows what they've built** → value visibility before decision
4. **Adviser support** → channel-supportive, not bypass
5. **Member-for-Life** → relationship continues beyond employment

### Questions to Anticipate:
- **Q**: "What if they still want to cash out?"
- **A**: "That's okay—we show honest consequences. But we make preservation the easier path."

- **Q**: "Does this work with our existing admin?"
- **A**: "Yes, this is an engagement layer on top. No admin changes needed."

- **Q**: "What about advisers?"
- **A**: "They're featured prominently. We support them, not replace them."

- **Q**: "How do we measure success?"
- **A**: "Preservation rate (target 70%+) and cash-out reduction (target <15%)."
