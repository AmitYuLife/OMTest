## 🎯 Screen Purpose

**Design Goal**: Make the member feel secure, informed, and empowered—showing that retirement and risk are natural partners, not separate products.

**Expected Impact**: If this screen works, members will:
- Return daily (60%+ DAU)
- Understand their total value (not just pension)
- Feel protected (security + peace of mind)
- Discover growth opportunities (without sales pressure)

## 🧠 Behavioral Design Principles

### 1. **Unified Value Framing**
- Total value shown first (R1,025k)
- Retirement + protection equal visual weight
- Activity feed combines all types

**Why**: Breaks down product silos.

### 2. **Positive Language**
- "Your future income" (not "pension pot")
- "Your family protection" (not "risk policy")
- "Building towards..." (progress framing)
- "You're well protected" (affirmation)

**Why**: Reduces anxiety, increases engagement.

### 3. **Optional Actions**
- Nudge is curiosity-driven ("See what you could do")
- Action tiles available but not pushed
- All CTAs optional (never "You must")

**Why**: Respects autonomy, builds trust.

### 4. **Progress Indicators**
- Growth: +12.3% this year
- Monthly increase: +R324
- Future projection: R450k+ at retirement

**Why**: Progress = motivation.

### 5. **Personalization**
- Greeting by name + time of day
- "Your" language throughout
- AI-driven nudges (future)

**Why**: Emotional connection.
