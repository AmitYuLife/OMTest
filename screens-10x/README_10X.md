### For In-Person Meeting
1. **Open on laptop** - project to screen if available
2. **Start with index.html** to show full scope

5. **Emphasize interactivity** - these are clickable, navigable

### Key Points to Emphasize While Demoing
- "This is the unified experience—retirement and risk together"
- "Notice the fee savings prominently shown—that's 10X's strength"
- "Screen D is the critical moment—job change preservation"
- "The fee comparison is explicit—R186k saved over 30 years"

- "Full product ecosystem for cross-sell—RA, unit trusts, tax-free"

### If COO Asks...
- **"How fast can we build this?"**
  → Tech-native platform = faster than traditional (6-12 months vs 18-24)
  
- **"What's the integration complexity?"**
  → APIs and data sync—10X already has digital infrastructure
  
- **"What's in it for members?"**
  → Lowest fees in SA + behavioral engagement = best outcomes
