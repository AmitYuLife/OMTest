### Old Mutual Partnership Opportunity

- Potential major deal: $6-5M+ annually if rolled out to existing book
- Moving from POC to deeper relationship with ~1M existing clients
- Core offering to existing book + upsell to full version
- Different from NN approach - more localized for South African market

### Product Requirements & Focus Areas

- Super Fund: Packaging pension and risk benefits together
- Key objectives:
  1. Increase member contributions through incentives
  2. Retain members (prevent departures to competitors)
  3. Cross-sell individual cover when employees leave
  4. Enable flexible benefit adjustments up/down
- Financial wellness focus across life stages
- Move from product selling to lifetime value approach
- ~15% of salary allocation across pensions, health, retirement, risk

### Design Brief & Deliverables

- Need 8 slides showing potential experience (similar to NN deck)
- Timeline pressure: Hal visiting SA week of Feb 16th (potentially Feb 9th)
- In-person meetings with Old Mutual key stakeholders planned
- Approach: Create stimulus materials first, then workshop if deal progresses
- Avoid extensive pre-work before financial commitment confirmed

### Design Process & Tools

- Amit to run brief through Pencil AI with Old Mutual branding
- George (NN pension UX expert) could provide input but unavailable due to wife’s imminent birth
- Jonathan considered for Pencil work but Amit can handle directly
- Rough screens sufficient for initial presentation - doesn’t need to be final

### Next Steps

- Jaco to send additional brief document with Old Mutual’s specific requirements
- Amit to create initial mockups with Old Mutual logos
- Team to collaborate via Slack on iterations
- Prepare materials for SA meetings (week of Feb 9th)
