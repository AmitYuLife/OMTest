🎨 Design Brief (Refined): Old Mutual ❤️ Yu
Unified Pensions + Risk Engagement Layer
1. What we are designing (very clear)
We are designing concept mock-up screens for a single, unified member experience where:
Retirement (Pensions) + Risk benefits live together in one view


Members can:


Understand total value
Make better choices over time
Preserve and continue benefits when leaving employment
Seamlessly upsell / cross-sell without friction or pressure


The experience sits above the Old Mutual SuperFund


Products, pricing, advisers and distribution remain unchanged


This is a member-first engagement and intelligence layer, not a product engine.
2. Brand & Naming
Brand treatment
Primary brand: Old Mutual
Co-brand: ❤️ Yu (subtle but visible)
Think: “Powered by Yu” rather than “YuLife takeover”


Visual cues
Old Mutual trust, warmth, stability
Yu behavioural intelligence, nudges, clarity
Clean, calm, human — never salesy


3. Core Concept to Show Visually
“One Financial Home”
 Retirement + Risk + Protection + Continuation — across your working life and beyond.
Every screen should reinforce:
These benefits belong together
They evolve with your life
Old Mutual stays with you, even when your employer changes


4. MUST-HAVE SCREENS (with explicit content)
A. Unified Member Home (Anchor Screen)
This is the most important screen.
Show clearly:
Retirement balance (pension)
Risk protection (life, disability, funeral)
Combined into one value view
Simple language:


“Your future income”
“Your family protection”


Small nudges:


“One small change could improve your future”
“You’re well protected — here’s why”


Also show (lightly):
Optional tiles:


“Top up protection”
“Add GAP cover”
“Explore coaching / wellbeing”


B. Active Employment – Smart Upsell & Cross-sell
Purpose: Show how upsell happens — gently.
Include:
Contextual prompts (not product lists):


“You’ve had a child — want to check your cover?”


“Your income increased — should protection keep up?”


Retirement + risk side-by-side


Optional actions:


Increase contribution
Add / adjust risk


Always optional, never forced


C. Life Event / AI-Supported Insight Screen
Purpose: Show intelligence, not complexity.
Include:
“Based on people like you…”


Simple scenarios:


“If nothing changes”
“If you tweak one thing”


Show impact across:


Retirement outcome
Risk adequacy


No actuarial graphs — clean, human visuals.

D. Employee Exit / Job Change Journey (CRITICAL)
This screen must clearly show preservation + continuation.
Show visually:
“You’re leaving your employer — your benefits don’t have to leave you”


Three paths (choice architecture):


Preserve with Old Mutual (highlighted / default)
Cash out (shown with consequences)
Transfer elsewhere


Explicitly include:
Pension preservation
Risk continuation (life / disability)
Adviser still present and supported
“Member-for-Life” positioning


This is the highest economic value moment — treat it with care and simplicity.
E. Continuation as an Individual (Post-Employment)
Purpose: Show seamless transition.
Include:
“You’re no longer employed — here’s your new Old Mutual home”
Same dashboard, same logic
Retirement + risk still combined
New optional products unlocked (if relevant)


Key message: Nothing breaks.
F. Pre- & Post-Retirement Guidance
Purpose: Show longevity of relationship.
Include:
Pre-retirement:


“You’re 10 years away — here’s what matters now”
Contribution vs protection balance


Post-retirement:


Living Annuity / SuperFund continuation
Sustainable drawdown nudges
Ongoing engagement


5. What Every Screen Should Implicitly Answer
Each mock-up should silently answer:
“Am I on track?”


“Am I protected?”
“What’s one simple thing I could do next?”
“What happens when my job changes?”


6. What NOT to Include (important)
Do not design:
Product brochures
Pricing tables
Underwriting journeys
Adviser replacement flows
Sales funnels


This is outcomes + behaviour, not selling.
7. Reference Context (for designer understanding)
Umbrella funds dominate SA retirement
Risk benefits naturally sit inside umbrella funds
Preservation at exit is the single biggest value unlock
Old Mutual already controls:

Admin
Capital
Products

9. One-Sentence Design North Star
Design a single Old Mutual ❤️ Yu experience where pensions and risk live together, adapt through life events, preserve value at job change, and support members for life — without changing products or pricing.
