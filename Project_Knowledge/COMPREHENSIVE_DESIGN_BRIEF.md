# Old Mutual ❤️ Yu: Comprehensive Design Brief
## Unified Pensions + Risk Engagement Layer

---

## Executive Summary

We are designing an 8-slide concept deck showing a behaviour-led, AI-enabled engagement layer that helps Old Mutual members optimize the ~15% of payroll typically allocated to retirement and risk benefits across their full lifetime—without changing core products, pricing, or distribution.

**Project Value**: $5-6M+ annually if rolled out to existing book of ~1M clients  
**Timeline**: Materials needed for SA meetings week of Feb 9th-16th (Hal visiting)  
**Deliverable**: 8 concept mock-up screens (rough/stimulus quality sufficient)

---

## 1. Strategic Context

### Business Opportunity
- Moving from POC to deeper relationship with Old Mutual's existing client base
- Different from NN approach—more localized for South African market
- Core offering to existing book + potential upsell to full version
- Umbrella funds dominate SA retirement market
- Risk benefits naturally sit inside umbrella funds

### The Problem We're Solving
Member lifecycle typically has critical value leakage points:
- **Onboarding**: Total reward value often invisible
- **Active employment**: Missed opportunities for optimization
- **Job change/exit**: High cash-out leakage (highest EV-impact moment)
- **Pre-retirement**: Poor decision quality due to lack of guidance
- **Post-retirement**: Disengagement leads to suboptimal drawdown

### Strategic Objectives
1. **Increase member contributions** through behavioral incentives
2. **Retain members** (prevent departures to competitors)
3. **Cross-sell individual cover** when employees leave employment
4. **Enable flexible benefit adjustments** (up/down) based on life changes
5. **Reduce preservation leakage** at job change moments
6. **Improve lifetime value** through duration, not pricing changes

---

## 2. What We Are Designing

### Core Concept
**"One Financial Home"**  
Retirement + Risk + Protection + Continuation—across your working life and beyond.

### Product Scope
A single, unified member experience where:
- **Retirement (Pensions) + Risk benefits** live together in one view
- Members can understand total value, make better choices, preserve benefits, and seamlessly access upsell/cross-sell
- The experience sits **above** the Old Mutual SuperFund
- Products, pricing, advisers, and distribution **remain unchanged**

### What This Is
✅ Member-first engagement and intelligence layer  
✅ Behavioral nudges and AI-assisted decision support  
✅ Unified lifetime value view across benefits  
✅ Preservation and continuation enabler  

### What This Is NOT
❌ A product engine or new product offering  
❌ A replacement for advisers or brokers  
❌ A sales funnel or pressure-based selling tool  
❌ A pricing or underwriting change

**Option 4**: Member Success Story / Outcomes View

*(Select based on what resonates most with Old Mutual stakeholders)*

---

## 6. Core Design Principles

Every screen should implicitly answer these questions:
1. **"Am I on track?"**
2. **"Am I protected?"**
3. **"What's one simple thing I could do next?"**
4. **"What happens when my job changes?"**

### Additional Principles
- **Behavioral, not transactional**: Focus on outcomes and nudges, not product features
- **Lifetime view**: Show how the relationship evolves over time
- **Preservation-first**: Emphasize continuity and value retention
- **AI-enabled, human-centered**: Intelligence should enhance, not replace, human decision-making
- **Channel-supportive**: Advisers and brokers are partners, not obstacles

---

## 7. What NOT to Include

Do NOT design:
❌ Product brochures  
❌ Pricing tables  
❌ Underwriting journeys  
❌ Adviser replacement flows  
❌ Sales funnels or pressure tactics  
❌ Complex actuarial visualizations  
❌ Industry jargon or technical terminology  

**This is about outcomes + behavior, not selling.**

---

## 8. Technical & Business Context

### From an Actuarial Lens
Focus on:
- **Preservation at exit** as the highest EV-impact moment
- Small behavioral improvements driving increased lifetime value
- Better engagement during employment to improve risk optimization
- AI-supported journeys that improve choices without changing product economics
- Contextual continuation, upsell, and cross-sell that increase value through duration
- Simpler journeys to reduce leakage and friction

### What Old Mutual Already Controls
- Admin infrastructure
- Capital and balance sheet
- Product suite
- Distribution relationships

**We're not changing any of this—we're adding an engagement intelligence layer on top.**

---

## 9. Project Constraints & Timeline

### Timeline
- **Critical deadline**: Week of Feb 9th-16th (Hal visiting SA)
