Ahead of our discussion, I wanted to briefly summarise the design focus for the session.

The intent is to design a behaviour-led, AI-enabled engagement layer that helps members optimise the ~15% of payroll typically allocated to retirement and risk benefits across their full lifetime — including job changes, preservation, continuation and post-retirement — without changing core products, pricing or distribution.

Member lifecycle focus:

Onboarding & early career: Making total reward and protection value visible; building good habits early.

Active employment: Ongoing financial-wellness journeys, with contextual upsell and cross-sell (risk, GAP, coaching) driven by life events rather than sales pressure.

Job change / exit (critical): Proactive, simple preservation journeys that reduce cash-out leakage and enable seamless continuation into Old Mutual Member-for-Life solutions, with brokers and advisers supported rather than bypassed.

Pre-retirement: AI-assisted education and scenario guidance to improve decision quality.

Post-retirement: Continued engagement via SuperFund / Living Annuity solutions, supporting sustainable drawdown behaviour.

From a light actuarial lens, the session would focus on:

Preservation at exit as the highest EV-impact moment, where small behavioural improvements drive increased lifetime value

Better engagement during employment to improve risk optimisation and experience

Behavioural and AI-supported journeys that improve contribution and retirement choices without changing product economics

Contextual continuation, upsell and cross-sell that increase lifetime value through duration, not pricing

Simpler journeys for members, employers and brokers to reduce leakage and friction

In short, this is not about changing products or pricing, but about designing a member-first engagement layer that improves preservation, protection and retirement outcomes across the payroll already being spent.
