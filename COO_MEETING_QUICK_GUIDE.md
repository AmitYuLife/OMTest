## 💡 If COO Asks...

**"How fast can we build this?"**
→ "6-12 months. You're tech-native, so integration is straightforward. These prototypes show the vision—now it's scoping and APIs."

**"What's the integration complexity?"**
→ "Much easier with you than traditional players. APIs for data sync, SSO for members, product mapping. You already have digital infrastructure."

**"What's in it for members?"**
→ "Lowest fees in SA + behavioral nudges = best outcomes. R186k saved over 30 years + better decisions throughout."

**"What about advisers?"**
→ "Hybrid model. Direct where it makes sense, adviser-supported where needed. Tech enhances advisers, doesn't replace them."

**"Commercial model?"**
→ "Revenue share on both retirement and risk. Yu owns the risk products—deeper partnership than just engagement layer."

**"Why now?"**
→ "30+ schemes ready to transfer. Market momentum. First-mover advantage on tech-enabled umbrella + risk solution."
