✅ Behavioral nudges  
✅ Lifecycle continuity

## Migration Strategy

### For Amit's Work

**Step 1**: Copy `/screens/` folder to `/screens-10x/`

**Step 2**: Create find-and-replace list:
```
"Old Mutual" → "10X"
"pension" → "retirement savings"
"SuperFund" → "Umbrella Fund"
"Your adviser" → "Your consultant" (or remove if too adviser-centric)
[Old Mutual colors] → [10X orange/coral]
```

**Step 3**: Screen-specific updates (use checklist in Modification Guide)

**Step 4**: Add new components:
- Fee comparison cards
- Fee savings callouts
- Expanded cross-sell tiles
- Simpler visualizations

**Step 5**: Polish and test

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Potential Issues

1. **10X brand assets not available**
   - Solution: Extract from website, refine later
   - Impact: Low - can launch with website-extracted assets

2. **Yu individual life insurance not fully defined**
   - Solution: Use placeholder copy, "coming soon" badge
   - Impact: Low - meeting is about concept, not final product

3. **Fee numbers not final**
   - Solution: Use realistic examples with disclaimer
   - Impact: Low - directionally correct matters more

4. **COO has different priorities**
   - Solution: Prototypes are flexible, easy to re-prioritize screens
   - Impact: Low - already built modular

---

## Recommendation for COO Meeting

### Show These 3 Screens (Minimum)

1. **Screen A** (Home): Shows the unified experience
2. **Screen D** (Exit): Shows the fee advantage at critical moment
3. **Screen H** (Lifecycle): Shows full journey and opportunity

**Why these 3?**
- Tells complete story
- Highlights 10X differentiation (fees)
- Shows Yu's role (risk products)
- Demonstrates tech-enabled experience
- Can be completed in 6-8 hours total

### Have Ready (but don't lead with)

4. Screen B (Upsell) - if COO asks about cross-sell
5. Screen C (AI Insights) - if COO asks about intelligence/personalization
6. Screen E (Individual) - if COO asks about post-employment
7. Screen F & G (Retirement) - if COO asks about late-stage journey

## Bottom Line: Is This Easy?

**YES.**

You're not building a new prototype. You're **rebranding and enhancing an existing one**.

- 85% of the work is done (structure, UX, interactions, flow)
- 10% is rebrand (colors, logos, tone)
- 5% is product swap and additions

The 10X version will actually be **cleaner and simpler** because:
- 10X brand is more minimal
- Fee story is straightforward
- Less corporate language needed
- Tech integration is more credible

**Time**: 15-20 hours for full 8 screens, or 6-8 hours for the critical 3 screens.

**Compared to**: 80-100 hours if starting from scratch.

**Value**: Prototype validates a $5-6M annual opportunity with active deal flow (30+ schemes).
